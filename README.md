## Overview
This project is a conversational AI application using the concept of Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG). It aims to provide contextually rich and accurate responses by utilizing content from a specific website. 


## Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG combines two major components in AI-driven conversational systems: a **retriever** that fetches relevant information from a data source (like a website), and a **generator** (typically a language model like GPT) that constructs responses based on this information. This approach ensures that the AI's responses are not just based on its pre-trained knowledge but are also informed by the specific context of the user's query and the website content.

## Step by step project overview

### Step 1: Initialization
Website Content Loading: When a user specifies a website URL, the system uses the get_vectorstore_from_url function to load the website's content. This function converts the text content of the website into a vector store, a searchable representation of the website's text.

### Step 2: Setting Up the Retriever Chain
Creating Context Retrieval Chain: The get_context_retriever_chain function is then invoked with the vector store as input. This function sets up a chain (retriever chain) to retrieve relevant information from the vector store. This chain will use the website's vector store to find content relevant to the user's current query and the overall conversation history.

### Step 3: Integrating the RAG Chain
Setting Up RAG Chain: Next, the get_conversational_rag_chain function takes the retriever chain as input and creates a RAG chain. This chain combines the information retrieval step (from the retriever chain) with a response generation step. The generation step is responsible for creating conversational responses that incorporate the retrieved website content.

### Step 4: Interaction and Response Generation
User Interaction: When a user types in a query or message, this input is processed by the system.
Generating Response: The get_response function is invoked with the user's input. This function uses the RAG chain to generate a response. It involves:
Invoking the retriever chain to get relevant context from the website based on the current user query and conversation history.
Using the retrieved context, along with the user's query, to generate a response through the RAG chain. The response is formulated in a way that is informed by the specific content of the website, ensuring relevance and accuracy.
